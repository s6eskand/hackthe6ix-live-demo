# Building a REST API with Django live demo

Live Demo for tutorial project for Hack The 6ix workshop 2020

This repository holds the code for the server used for the live demo. The code for the client can be found [here](https://github.com/s6eskand/hackthe6ix-workshop/tree/master/demo-client)

If you would like to see the final product in action (authentication and all) navigate to https://music-rating.netlify.app. You can either create a new account and start with a blank slate, or play around with the test account which has some already populated data.

Rules for test account:

  * Don't delete the JoJo song please
  * Don't post anything that will make me sad or is offensive
  * Credentials:
      * username: _demoaccount_
      * password: _hackthe6ix_
      
     
Have fun! Don't break the site, I didn't spend too long on the front end.
